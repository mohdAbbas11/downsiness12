TESTING THE CIRCUIT:
------------------
1. Upload the "arduino_drowsiness_alert.ino" sketch to your Arduino
2. When powered on, you should see:
   - All LEDs blink twice
   - Buzzer plays ascending tones
   - Green LED stays on (normal state)

3. Use the arduino_test.py script to test communication:
   - Run: python arduino_test.py
   - Select your Arduino's COM port
   - The script will send test signals to verify all alerts work

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
1. No LEDs light up:
   - Check power to Arduino
   - Verify LED polarity (longer leg should connect to Arduino pins through resistors)
   - Check resistor connections

2. No sound from buzzer:
   - Check buzzer polarity
   - Try a different buzzer
   - Verify PIN 9 connection

3. Communication issues:
   - Verify correct COM port is selected
   - Check USB connection
   - Try resetting Arduino
   - Close any other programs that might be using the serial port

ALERT SIGNALS:
------------
The system sends the following codes to Arduino:
- '0': Normal state (green LED on)
- '1': Drowsiness detected (red LED blinking + high-pitched buzzer)
- '2': Yawning detected (yellow LED blinking)
- '3': Head down detected (red LED blinking + medium-pitched buzzer)
- '4': Eyes closed detected (red LED blinking + different-pitched buzzer)
